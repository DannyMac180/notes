# The Extended Mind

## Author(s): David Chalmers and Andy Clark

Notes from David Chalmers and Andy Clark's paper ["The Extended Mind"]([url](https://www.alice.id.tue.nl/references/clark-chalmers-1998.pdf))

There are three scenarios that are explored:

1. A 3D object on a computer screen and you can rotate it with a button to fit into a hole
2. Same object but there is not button - you must rotate inside your "mind's eye"
3. You have a neural implant that allows you to rotate the object as fast as with the button

Chalmers + Clark argue that the amount of cognition needed to perform all three actions is equivalent

They go on to argue that use of these tools represents "external cognition" - the basis for the extended mind

The external features in active externalism are equally causal as the internal, brain features wrt cognition

"Is mind in the present?"

We think that our mind - or our "cognition" is separate from the environment. That the self and world are separated from each other. This is Cartesian dualism. But the evidence points to the fact that this is not the case and that our cognition is happening in the environment and is coupled to the "internal" processes

It's amazing that they wrote this about a decade before the iPhone and mobile computing revolution

Language may have formed as the original tool for externalizing thought

There is a counter-argument that the constancy of Inga's memory as opposed to Otto's physical notebook makes Inga's memory more fundamental

A belief must be *available* for consciousness
