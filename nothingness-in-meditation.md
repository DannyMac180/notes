Summary of "Nothingness in Meditation: Making Sense of Emptiness and Cessation"
This paper delves into the complex and nuanced concepts of "nothingness" within Buddhist philosophy and contemplative practice, specifically focusing on two distinct experiences: emptiness (no-thingness) and cessation (nothingness). It seeks to differentiate these concepts, explore their potential benefits and drawbacks, and offer possible computational models to understand them.
Key Concepts:
Emptiness (No-thingness): The understanding that all phenomena, including the self, are devoid of inherent, independent existence and arise interdependently. This aligns with the Madhyamaka school of Mahayana Buddhism and is often described as "seeing that frees".
Cessation (Nothingness): A temporary 'gap' or absence in the stream of consciousness, often experienced as a 'cut' followed by clarity and openness. This concept is prominent in Theravada Buddhism and is associated with the path to liberation from suffering.
Misconceptions: The paper emphasizes the need to distinguish emptiness and cessation from other altered states of consciousness like those induced by psychedelics or even sleep, which may share similar descriptions but have different underlying mechanisms and implications.
Influences on the Mind and Brain:
Psychological Effects: Emptiness can lead to non-attachment, decreased negative affect, and increased compassion. Cessation is linked to the progressive elimination of mental "fetters" that bind us to suffering, ultimately leading to liberation.
Neurophysiological Correlates: Research on emptiness is limited, but parallels with psychedelic experiences suggest possible downregulation of the Default Mode Network (DMN) and Salience Network (SLN). Studies on cessation show alterations in alpha and gamma brainwave activity, suggesting changes in network integration and potentially the unlearning of habitual conditioning.
Adverse Effects: While emptiness and cessation are generally associated with positive outcomes, potential challenges like dissociation, derealization, and even psychosis can arise in susceptible individuals or with improper practice. The paper emphasizes the importance of balanced practice and the role of calm and tranquility (samatha) in mitigating potential negative effects.
The Journey to Nothingness:
The paper explores different pathways to achieving cessation, including:
Jhāna Practice: A gradual progression through refined states of concentration, culminating in nirodha samāpatti, a state of extended cessation.
Vipassanā (Insight) Meditation: This path involves cultivating specific insights into the nature of reality, like impermanence, suffering, and not-self, ultimately leading to cessation.
Contemplative Science Model: This framework categorizes meditation practices into focused attention, open monitoring, and non-dual awareness, each progressively reducing the temporal depth and abstractness of cognition, potentially leading to cessation.
Computational Directions:
The paper proposes that the predictive processing framework can offer valuable insights into understanding emptiness and cessation:
Predictive Processing and Emptiness: The brain's reliance on predictive models aligns with the concept of emptiness, where all experiences are constructed and lack inherent existence.
Predictive Processing and Cessation: Relaxing the precision of predictions across the temporal hierarchy may explain the gradual deconstruction of the mind leading to cessation.
Future Research: Further investigation is needed to understand how insights into emptiness permanently eliminate mental fetters and how these concepts relate to suffering and its cessation.
Interesting Quotes:
"For the one who sees, there is no thing." - The Buddha, Udana 8.2
"Form is emptiness, emptiness is form." - Heart Sūtra
"Theoretical understanding wears out like patches. Experiences fade away like haze. But realization remains unchanging like space." - saying in Tibetan Buddhism
"In fact, we're all hallucinating all the time, including right now. It's just that when we agree about our hallucinations, we call that reality." - Anil Seth
"When things dissolve, there’s nothing left to say." - Nāgārjuna
Conclusion:
This paper provides a valuable overview of the concepts of emptiness and cessation in meditation, offering potential explanations and avenues for future research. It highlights the importance of differentiating these concepts from other altered states and emphasizes their potential for alleviating suffering and fostering well-being.
