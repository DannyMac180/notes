# The Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness

The five Skhandas are:

1. Form - the physical body and related physical objects outside of the boundary of your skin
2. Sensation - the pleasant, unpleasant and neutral feelings that arise from the contact between the senses and their objects
3. Perception - the ability to recognize and label objects, people and experiences based on their characteristics
4. Mental Formations - thoughts, emotions and volitions/intentions that shape the habits and tendencies of an indivudal
5. Consciousness - the awareness that arises from the interaction between the senses and their objects and the mental processes

"How can a material world exist outside the sense and yet also be the senses that experience it? To say that everything can be explained in terms of the material world does not answer anything. It does not even begin to address itself to the question of what concsious experience is, let alone to the question of what might or might not exists external to it."

This is a very lucid argument against the scientific materialists that say the mind is simply an epiphenomenon of the brain. I believe it's the exact opposite - the brain doesn't create the mind but rather the brain creates the mind. Or at a minimum they are arising as two sides of the same coin.

I do like this book and I feel that I've taken something away from it - mainly about the fundamental Tibetan Buddhist understanding. At the same time there were parts of it that I couldn't connect with - maybe a cultural thing? Some of the words are hard to pronounce which I feel makes it disconnected.
