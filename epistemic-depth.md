## Takeways
- You are the reality model and the reality model is you. To know yourself is to know the world and to know the world is to know yourself

If we don't believe (have a prior) that an experience can happen to us, it literally can't

Our mind and priors dictate the range of experience that we can experience

What is meant "Inferential Competition" is that the phenomena we experience that becomes conscious is most likely to be those phenomena which add to coherence and boundedness of our reality model

> ([[DEPTH_LaukkonenChandaria.pdf#page=8&annotation=466R|DEPTH_LaukkonenChandaria, p.8]])
> The key takeaway of this section is that Bayesian binding is (in theory) at the heart of all experience, from unimodal processes, multisensory binding, through to global integration

Knowledge is power, self-knowledge is wisdom

What we pay attention to becomes what we experience ourselves to be

It's only possible to know yourself against the backdrop of an epistemic field. In other words, having a human life gives God a vehicle to know Itself through

**Short Answer Key:**

1. The reality model is an organism's experienced world, a generated, phenomenal, and unified representation of its lived reality. It's considered necessary for consciousness because it defines what can be known, acted upon, and become aware.
2. Active inference, driven by an organism's need to minimize prediction errors and maintain itself, guides the construction of the reality model. This involves predicting incoming sensory data and updating the model based on discrepancies.
3. Bayesian binding is the process of combining prior expectations (beliefs) with incoming sensory data to form a coherent posterior perception. This hierarchical process of integrating information shapes conscious experience by determining which interpretations are prioritized.
4. Epistemic depth is the capacity for knowing or awareness, ranging from unclear (e.g., dreaming) to highly clear (e.g., mindfulness). It's linked to "luminosity," the degree to which the reality model knows itself, reflecting the clarity of awareness.
5. The reality model becomes aware of itself through a reflexive loop, where the constructed model is continuously fed back as input, similar to how we hear and process our own voice while speaking. This recursive sharing leads to "field-evidencing."
6. Lucid dreaming is explained as a state of increased epistemic depth during REM sleep, allowing for awareness of the dream state. Practices promoting epistemic depth while awake (e.g., mindfulness) can increase the likelihood of lucid dreaming.
7. MPE is a state of pure awareness with minimal or no specific content, often characterized by luminosity and a sense of "oneness." It arises when the reality model is simplified, and the dominant signal is the reflexivity of awareness itself.
8. Dereification is the recognition that experiential phenomena are mental constructs, not inherent realities. It's linked to increased epistemic depth as mindful observation allows for recognizing the constructed nature of thoughts and emotions.
9. Instead of attributing expanded consciousness solely to relaxed beliefs (as in the REBUS model), Epistemic Depth Theory suggests that psychedelics increase the recursive sharing of the reality model, leading to a heightened sense of awareness and knowingness.
10. While AI systems can generate complex representations, they currently lack the reflexive loops crucial for epistemic depth. They may not possess the capacity to "know what they know" in the same way biological systems do, potentially limiting their consciousness.

**Essay Questions:**

1. Critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of Laukkonen & Chandaria's Epistemic Depth Theory in explaining consciousness. How does it compare to other prominent theories of consciousness?
2. Discuss the implications of the Epistemic Depth Theory for understanding the relationship between attention, metacognition, and conscious awareness.
3. How does the Epistemic Depth Theory explain the varying degrees of awareness experienced in different states of consciousness, such as sleep, dreaming, and meditative states?
4. Analyze the authors' arguments regarding the potential for artificial consciousness in light of the Epistemic Depth Theory. What breakthroughs in AI development would be necessary to achieve genuine epistemic depth in artificial systems?
5. Explore the ethical considerations surrounding the potential development of artificial consciousness based on the principles of epistemic depth. How might such advancements impact our understanding of personhood, moral status, and our responsibilities towards sentient AI?

**Glossary of Key Terms:**

- **Active Inference:** A theoretical framework proposing that brains operate by minimizing prediction errors, constantly generating models to anticipate incoming sensory information.
- **Bayesian Binding:** The process of combining prior beliefs with sensory evidence to form a coherent perception, utilizing Bayesian probability principles.
- **Cessation:** In the context of meditation, an experience characterized by a temporary cessation of the reality model and conscious experience, leading to profound insights and altered perspectives.
- **Dereification:** Recognizing that our subjective experiences (thoughts, emotions, self) are mental constructs rather than inherent, unchanging realities.
- **Epistemic Depth:** The capacity for knowing or awareness, ranging from unclear to highly clear, reflecting the degree to which the reality model knows itself.
- **Field-Evidencing:** The continuous self-validation of the reality model through its own existence and updates, akin to a self-confirming loop.
- **Generative Model:** An internal model within an organism that actively generates predictions about the causes of sensory input, simulating its environment.
- **Global Workspace Theory (GWT):** A theory of consciousness proposing that conscious experience arises from a "global workspace" in the brain, where information is broadly shared and available for processing.
- **Hierarchical Predictive Processing:** A model where the brain processes information through a hierarchy of levels, each level predicting and interpreting the activity of the level below.
- **Integrated Information Theory (IIT):** A theory of consciousness that quantifies consciousness as the amount of integrated information a system possesses.
- **Luminosity:** A metaphorical term, often used in contemplative traditions, referring to the clarity or degree of knowing, aligning with the concept of epistemic depth.
- **Minimal Phenomenal Experience (MPE):** A state of pure awareness with minimal or no specific content, often characterized by luminosity and a sense of "oneness."
- **Prediction Error:** The discrepancy between predicted sensory input (based on the internal model) and actual sensory input, driving model updates.
- **Reflexivity:** In the context of consciousness, the capacity for a system to become aware of its own awareness, to "know that it knows."
- **Reality Model:** An organism's complete experienced world, a generated, phenomenal, and unified internal model representing its lived reality.
- **Uncertainty Reduction:** The driving force behind active inference, where organisms aim to minimize uncertainty and surprise by improving their predictive models.
