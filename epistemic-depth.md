## Takeways
- You are the reality model and the reality model is you. To know yourself is to know the world and to know the world is to know yourself

If we don't believe (have a prior) that an experience can happen to us, it literally can't

Our mind and priors dictate the range of experience that we can experience

What is meant "Inferential Competition" is that the phenomena we experience that becomes conscious is most likely to be those phenomena which add to coherence and boundedness of our reality model

> The key takeaway of this section is that Bayesian binding is (in theory) at the heart of all experience, from unimodal processes, multisensory binding, through to global integration

Knowledge is power, self-knowledge is wisdom

What we pay attention to becomes what we experience ourselves to be

It's only possible to know yourself against the backdrop of an epistemic field. In other words, having a human life gives God a vehicle to know Itself through


# 3 Conditions for Consciousness

1. Reality or World Model
2. Inferential Competition - (My Definition) The process of sensory input arriving into the nervous system and how we determine which sensory inputs are incorporated into our reality model
3. Epistemic Depth

>  We also find that the notion of epistemic depth has some surprising implications, including that attention, meta-cognition, meta-awareness, and possibly System 2 (Kahneman, 2011), may be subsumed or deflated

> Active inference can be derived from two assumptions: (1) the imperative for biological systems to maintain a boundary between themselves and the environment (i.e., existence), 4 and (2) the necessity to visit a specific set of states compatible with continued existence (i.e., adaptive actions).

> equence of a system that reduces uncertainty with sufficient complexity and depth. The factors that drive precision are of course manifold, including salience, top-down attention, context contingencies, coherence, uncertainty, confidence, reward, neuromodulators, and previous learning more generally.

> What we mean by the term epistemic depth is therefore a capacity or continuum (i.e., deepening) of knowing, or awareness, that can be more or less active (i.e., intense or clear)
> ([[DEPTH_LaukkonenChandaria.pdf#page=9&annotation=478R|DEPTH_LaukkonenChandaria, p.9]])
> Formally, we propose that epistemic depth is a combination of the precision of specific contents in the reality model, and a global reality model reflexivity precision parameter (or simply, reflexivity precision, homologous to the degree of luminosity).

> “...my own working hypothesis is that consciousness is our inner model of an “epistemic space,” a space in which pos-si-ble and -actual states of knowledge can be represented. I think that conscious beings are precisely those who have a model of their own space of knowledge—-they are systems that (in an entirely nonlinguistic and nonconceptual way) know that they currently have the capacity to know something.”3
