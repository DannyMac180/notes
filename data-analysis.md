Here are some potential questions and answers related to feature engineering and selection, tailored for a Google Cloud AI/ML Consultant interview:

**Question 1:**

* **Interviewer:** "Let's say you're working with a dataset for predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company.  The dataset includes call records with timestamps. How could you use feature engineering to extract valuable information from these timestamps?"

* **Your Answer:** "Feature engineering on timestamps can unlock a lot of predictive power.  I could extract features like:
    * **Day of the week:** To see if churn patterns vary by day.
    * **Hour of the day:** To identify peak churn times.
    * **Weekends vs. weekdays:**  To capture differences in weekend/weekday behavior.
    * **Time since last call:**  A longer gap might indicate a disengaged customer.
    * **Number of calls during specific time windows:** This could reveal usage patterns indicative of churn.
    * **Call duration:** Lengthy calls could signal different behavior than short calls.
    * **Frequency of calls:** How often a customer calls might be relevant.
These features might reveal hidden patterns related to churn that aren't directly apparent in the raw timestamps."

**Question 2:**

* **Interviewer:**  "You mentioned feature selection. How would you decide which features to keep and which to discard in this churn prediction scenario?"

* **Your Answer:** "Feature selection is key for model efficiency and preventing overfitting.  I'd use a combination of techniques:
    * **Filter methods:** Calculate feature importance scores (e.g., chi-squared, ANOVA) to quickly identify potentially irrelevant features.
    * **Wrapper methods:** Use recursive feature elimination to iteratively remove features and evaluate model performance.
    * **Embedded methods:** Employ L1 regularization during model training to automatically shrink the weights of less important features, effectively performing feature selection as part of the training process.
    * **Domain expertise:** Work with subject matter experts at the telecom company to understand which features might be practically relevant to churn.
The final feature set would be based on a combination of these quantitative and qualitative evaluations."


**Question 3:**

* **Interviewer:** "Let's say you've engineered many new features and now have a high-dimensional dataset.  What are the potential downsides of this, and how would you address them?"

* **Your Answer:**  "High dimensionality can lead to:
    * **Increased computational cost:**  Model training becomes slower and more resource-intensive.
    * **Overfitting:**  The model might learn noise in the high-dimensional space and generalize poorly to new data.
    * **Curse of dimensionality:**  In very high dimensions, data points become sparsely distributed, making it harder to find meaningful patterns.

To address these, I'd consider:
    * **Dimensionality reduction:** Techniques like PCA or t-SNE to reduce the number of features while preserving important information.
    * **Feature selection:** As discussed earlier, to choose the most relevant features.
    * **Regularization:**  To penalize complex models and prevent overfitting in the high-dimensional space."

**Question 4:**

* **Interviewer:** "Can you explain the difference between feature selection and feature extraction, and give an example of each?"

* **Your Answer:** "Feature selection chooses a subset of the original features, while feature extraction creates new features from the existing ones.

    * **Feature selection example:**  In the churn dataset, selecting only 'call duration,' 'data usage,' and 'customer service calls' as predictors, discarding other less relevant features.
    * **Feature extraction example:** Combining 'total call duration' and 'number of calls' to create a new feature called 'average call duration,' which might be more informative."

**Question 5:**

* **Interviewer:** "How does feature engineering relate to the bias-variance tradeoff?"

* **Your Answer:**  "Good feature engineering can improve the bias-variance tradeoff:
    * **Reduces bias:**  By creating features that capture the underlying patterns in the data, we can use less complex models and still achieve good performance, reducing bias.
    * **Reduces variance:**  By removing irrelevant features, we can decrease the model's sensitivity to noise in the training data, reducing variance.
The goal is to find the set of features that allows the model to accurately represent the data without overfitting."


These examples provide a starting point.  Remember to tailor your answers to the specific context of the interview and the types of problems Google Cloud AI/ML Consultants typically encounter.  Focus on demonstrating your practical experience and your ability to apply feature engineering and selection techniques to real-world scenarios.

My notes:

You can think about feature engineering and data analysis from the POV of tabular data. Essentially the features are the columns in the data and any sort of analysis is going to happen based on the various columns
