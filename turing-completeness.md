A computer (or a computational system) is said to be "Turing Complete" if it can perform any calculation or solve any computational problem that a Turing machine can, given the necessary time and resources. This concept is named after the mathematician and logician Alan Turing, who introduced the idea of the Turing machine as a theoretical model of computation.

In essence, a Turing Complete system must be able to:

1. **Simulate Conditional Logic**: It should be able to execute conditional branching, such as "if-then-else" statements.
2. **Perform Arbitrary Computations**: It must support the capability to perform any kind of mathematical calculation or algorithm.
3. **Manipulate Memory**: It should have some form of memory that can be read from and written to, allowing for data storage and retrieval during computation.
4. **Support Iteration and Recursion**: It should be able to perform repetitive tasks through loops (iteration) and function calls within function calls (recursion).

For example, most modern programming languages (like Python, Java, and C++) and most computers are Turing Complete because they can perform these fundamental operations. Even some simple systems, such as cellular automata or certain types of card games when generalized, can be Turing Complete if they meet these criteria.

In practical terms, Turing Completeness is a measure of the power and flexibility of a computational system, indicating that it can theoretically solve any problem that can be defined algorithmically.
