# Being You
## Author: Anil Seth

* The "real" problem of consciousness Seth defines as being able to explain, predicat and control concsiousness
* Seth describes an experiment where TMS was used to generate a sort of "tap" on the brain, then the response was recorded using EEG. They analyzed the "algorithmic complexity" to get a measure of the level of consciousness of the subject
    * I like this idea because it makes intuitive sense to me
* Bayesian reasoning in a nutshell - you take your prior beliefs and knowledge, combine it with the evidence you get from experience and that euqals your posterior probability of an event
