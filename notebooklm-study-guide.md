Short Answer Key
Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function, typically the loss function, during the training process. It works by adjusting the model's parameters (weights) in the direction of the steepest descent of the loss function, aiming to minimize the error between predicted and actual values.
The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls the step size at each iteration of gradient descent. A learning rate that's too small can lead to slow convergence and getting stuck in local minima. Conversely, a learning rate that's too large can cause the algorithm to overshoot the minimum and potentially diverge.
Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This penalty discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns that might only exist in the training data, leading to better generalization on unseen data.
The bias-variance tradeoff describes the balance between a model's ability to fit the training data (bias) and its ability to generalize to unseen data (variance). High bias can lead to underfitting, while high variance can lead to overfitting. Finding the right balance is crucial for achieving optimal model performance.
Supervised learning utilizes labeled data, where each example includes both input features and the corresponding desired output. Its goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs for accurate predictions on new data. Examples include linear regression and decision trees. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, works with unlabeled data, aiming to discover hidden patterns and structures. Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.
Feature engineering involves transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying patterns for improved model accuracy. It enhances model performance by highlighting relevant information, reducing noise, and enabling the model to learn more effectively from the data.
Feature Scaling: This technique standardizes the range of numerical features, preventing features with larger scales from dominating the learning process. One-Hot Encoding: This method converts categorical variables into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms. Creating Interaction Terms: This involves generating new features by combining existing ones, capturing interactions and relationships between them that might not be evident individually.
Feature selection is the process of identifying the most relevant features for a model. By removing irrelevant or redundant features, we improve model efficiency, reduce overfitting, and enhance interpretability.
Filter methods: This approach ranks features based on statistical measures like correlation or chi-squared tests. Features with high scores are selected, while those with low scores are discarded. Wrapper methods: This involves evaluating different subsets of features by training and evaluating the model on each subset. The subset yielding the best performance is selected.
Feature engineering can help optimize the bias-variance tradeoff. Well-engineered features can reduce bias by capturing true patterns and relationships. They can also reduce variance by eliminating irrelevant features that might introduce noise and lead to overfitting.
