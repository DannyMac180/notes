Kuhn has two main aims: 1. Organize the various theories of consciousness and 2. Assess their implications with regards to the meaning purpose and value of consciousness, potential for AI consciousness, potential for virtual immortality and potential for survival beyond death

The consciousness that we're talking about here is the phenomenal sort

'Consciousness is still a kind of illusion or trick in that there is no “top-down causation” '

Even if that is true on some level, I can't imagine how you could possibly live and function believing that

### 9.1.4 Emergence
- Emergence is the idea that consciousness is a property that emerges from the interaction of its constituents that is not contained with any single part
- Davies used the analogy of "wetness" of water - water is said to be wet but it would make no sense to talk about the wetness of a single H2O molecule

### 9.1.6 Searle's Biological Naturalism
- Searle sees consciousness as irreducible and fundamental, and that every conscious state is caused by a brain state

### 9.1.8 Flanagan's Constructive Naturalism
- “Mind and brain are one and the same thing seen from two different perspectives. The gap between the subjective and the objective is an epistemic gap, not an ontological gap.”

### 9.1.9 Papineau's Mind-Brain Identity
- Mind brain identity is essentially the idea that the mind and brain are in fact identical to each other.
