# The Experience Machine

**Author**: Andy Clark

**Type**: Hardcover
  
* Four key elements make up the model of Predictive Processing in the brain:
	1. Generative Model - what you already know / believe about yourself and the world. We are projecting this out onto the world (and not as much receiving the world passively as we would believe)
	2. Predictions - the moment to moment beliefs about our sensory information and what is happening in our environment. The environment includes our thoughts and feelings
	3. Prediction Errors - the degree to which our predictions are misaligned with the evidence we are getting from sensory input
	4. Precision Weighting - the degree to which we are giving our attention to certain salient features of the environment. How much we are paying attention to a particular feature
* Aesthetic chills are an emotional signal from the body that signify the important information has been revealed which resolves important uncertainties
	* I've experienced this most often with music (and other works of art) - is it that sometimes music reveals and resolves the uncertainty around a transcendent reality beyond our mundane experience?
* Psychedelics can help us to release the grip that our most basic beliefs and most fundamental predictions about reality have on us - and not just the reality of our environment but more importantly the reality of ourselves
* My key takeaway from this lovely book is that we are far less passive in the world than common sense would lead us to believe. We think we are passively observing the world and environment but the predictive processing model shows us that we are much more "generating" our experience based on evidence from neuroscience and cognitive science
