Today's LLMs imo can do a sort of reasoning, but it's not exactly to the level of human reasoning

Yesterday we got a scoop from The Information that OpenAI is in fact looking to deploy an AI model called Strawberry which has human-like reasoning capabilities. They've even gone so far as to demonstrate it to government agencies

So what could a truly reasoning AI do that today's LLMs can't yet?

Here are some ideas:

- Ability to deeply understand context and nuance - and not just via text input but through voice and image so that they can take more of the being of the human they're working with into consideration in their response
- Generate new, testable scientific theories that don't exist today
- Invent truly novel and creative solutions to problems
- Originate ideas for new works of art
- Solve complex problems that require multi-step reasoning while understanding deeply the causal chain and relationships
- Apply the reasoning abilities to its own architecture to recursively self-improve
